This contains python implementations of graphical model algorithms.

This is based on the Matlab implementations in: http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Software/UGM.html

Example Usage:

Run `python main.py -d graph_cut` to show the results of applying `ICM` and `GraphCut` algorithms on the far-left image below.
