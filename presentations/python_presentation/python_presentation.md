# First steps

Launch Jupyter

* Type the following in command prompt or terminal

```python
> jupyter notebook
```

# Main types

## 1. Integers

```python
a = 3
b = 5

print a + b
```

## 2. Float

```python
a = 3.56
b = 5.23

print a + b
```

# Main types

## 3. String

```python
name = "Hello World"

print name
```

# Importing libraries

```python
import numpy as np

np.log(3)
np.exp(5)
np.array([3,2,1])
```

```python
import pylab as plt

plt.scatter([1,2,3,4], [1,2,3,4])
```

# Data Science

* The term "data science" has exploded in business environments

# Data Science

* Many academics and journalists see no distinction between data science and statistics

# Data Science

**Nate Silver**

* Sexed-up term for statistics. Statistics is a branch of science. Data scientist is slightly redundant in some way and people shouldnâ€™t berate the term statistician

# Data Science


* Find and interpret rich data sources

* Create visualizations to aid in understanding data

* Data Scientists are people who turn data into applications

# Titanic Dataset

**On April 15, 1912**

* the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg
    * killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. 
    * There were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.

 * Some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

**Task**

* What sorts of people were likely to survive ?

* Use Data Science or Machine Learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
